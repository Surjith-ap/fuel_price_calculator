To calculate the amount of fuel required for a given distance, you need this formula:
Fuel Required = Distance ÷ Fuel Efficiency
Where:

Distance is in kilometers (or miles)
Fuel Efficiency is in km/L (or miles/gallon)
Result is in liters (or gallons)

If you want to calculate the cost of fuel needed, then:
Fuel Cost = Fuel Required × Fuel Price per Liter
Complete formula combining both:
Total Fuel Cost = (Distance ÷ Fuel Efficiency) × Fuel Price per Liter
Example:

Distance: 300 km
Vehicle efficiency: 15 km/L
Petrol price: ₹100/L

Fuel required = 300 ÷ 15 = 20 liters
Total cost = 20 × ₹100 = ₹2,000
